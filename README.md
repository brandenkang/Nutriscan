# About NutriScan

NutriScan is a web application that gives you the nutritional information you need with just the snap of a picture.

We live in a very health-conscious society. It's important to be aware of the nutrients in your food, but it's not always easy... That's why we created NutriScan, a simple, intuitive web application that gives you the nutritional breakdown of what you are eating. With only a picture from your smartphone, NutriScan can tell you the amount of calories, and macronutrients in your food. Not only that, but NutriScan can also keep track of your health and nutritional intake, allowing you to make long-term dietary plans and goals. 

On top of this, Nutriscan analyzes users' data, such as at what times the user is usually eating, how many calories on average the user is consuming on a weekly basis, and whether the user is strictly avoiding foods that contain fat or carbohydrates, in order to detect potential eating disorders such as anorexia or binge-eating disorder in their early stages. 

Nutriscan was built using React, Flask and the Google Cloud Platform.
